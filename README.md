Features

- Task Management

  - Task Categorization: Tasks are organized into various lists based on different life aspects such as Primary, Education, Business, Personal, etc. Each list is further subdivided into Current, Executing, On Hold, Postponed, and If Possible, ensuring a clear and structured approach to task management.
  - Current Tasks: A dedicated Current list aggregates tasks from different categories that need immediate attention - today, this week, maybe this month. During busy times, tasks can be split into morning, afternoon, and evening segments for better time management.
  - Task Characteristics: Tasks can have multiple features including priority, sub-tasks, parental tasks, deadlines, and notes. These characteristics should be viewed with a button click or on hover, providing a compact and comfortable interface.
  - Task Hierarchy: Tasks should be visually highlighted to indicate priority, the presence of sub-tasks, parental tasks and deadlines. Users will be able to quickly navigate to a task's parental task, facilitating seamless task tracking and management.

- Integration with Reminders and Calendar

  - Reminders: Seamlessly integrate Reminders with tasks. Create reminders for task deadlines or any other task-related activity directly from the task management interface. Move easily from Reminders to related tasks and back.
  - Calendar Events: Link tasks with calendar events to see how events impact the progress of tasks. Move easily from events to related tasks and back, ensuring that all task-related information is accessible and interconnected.

- User-Friendly Interface

  - Compact Design: The application will have a design that allows users to manage tasks without overwhelming them with information. Task details can be expanded or collapsed, viewed on hover, or accessed through quick actions.



Additional ideas

- Extended Task Features: Introduce more characteristics and customization options for tasks.
- Advanced Notifications: Enhance reminder and notification features for better task deadline management.
- Mobile Support: Develop a mobile-friendly version to manage tasks on-the-go.
- Collaboration: Implement features that support task sharing and collaboration among users.



Conclusion

Daily Plans Controller is poised to become an indispensable tool for anyone looking to manage their tasks efficiently. By integrating Notes, Calendar, and Reminders into a single, cohesive system, it aims to provide a seamless task management experience that adapts to the user's needs.
